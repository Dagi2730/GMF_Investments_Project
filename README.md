# GMF Investments Project

This project is part of the GMF Investments Challenge, designed to leverage advanced data science techniques for financial forecasting and portfolio management. The focus is on analyzing historical asset prices, predicting future market movements, and constructing optimized investment portfolios to help clients maximize returns while managing risk effectively.

## Project Goals

1. Time Series Forecasting:  
   Utilize state-of-the-art forecasting models such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM to analyze historical stock prices and predict future price trends. These models help capture patterns, seasonality, and volatility inherent in financial time series data.

2. Portfolio Optimization:  
   Apply portfolio optimization techniques including Mean-Variance Optimization and Sharpe Ratio maximization to construct portfolios that balance risk and return. By integrating forecasted returns with historical covariance, the project aims to recommend optimal asset allocations.

3. Data Visualization and Reporting:  
   Create clear, insightful visualizations and comprehensive summaries of findings to support decision-making. This includes trend analysis, risk assessment, and performance evaluation presented in an accessible format for stakeholders.
